abstract = {We formulate and present a stability analysis for the local discontinuous Galerkin method applied to a model of three-dimensional shallow water flow. This model is described by the Navier–Stokes equations, assuming hydrostatic pressure. The resulting system of equations is given by momentum equations for the x and y components of velocity, the continuity equation, which is used to solve for the vertical component of velocity, and an equation describing the motion of the free surface. Our analysis includes the full nonlinearities in the model with no simplifying assumptions and accounts for the movement of the mesh due to the free surface. To our knowledge this is the first analysis of any numerical scheme for this complex system of equations. Numerical results are presented which demonstrate the accuracy of the method for a problem with a known analytical solution.}

It is shown that initial boundary value problems with various boundary conditions for this miscible displacement possess a weak solution under physically reasonable hypotheses on the data. In the second part of this paper, it is proven how the analysis can be extended to two-phase fluid flow and transport equations in a porous medium. The flow equations are written in a fractional flow formulation so that a degenerate elliptic-parabolic partial differential system is produced for a global pressure and a saturation. This degenerate system is coupled to a parabolic transport equation which models the concentration of one of the fluids. The analysis here does not utilize any regularized problem; a weak solution is obtained as a limit of solutions to discrete time problems. }

A priori error estimates are derived and numerical results presented, which demonstrate that this method is order k+1 for both the gradient and state variable in the L2 norm. This improves upon earlier LDG methods which use equal order approximating spaces for both variables, but lose an order of accuracy in the gradient approximation. This approach is also the first convergent LDG method which allows for piecewise constant approximations for the state variable. }

These methods are an extension of the Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods for purely hyperbolic systems to convection-diffusion systems and share with those methods their high parallelizability, high-order formal accuracy, and easy handling of complicated geometries for convection-dominated problems. It is proven that for scalar equations, the LDG methods are L2-stable in the nonlinear case. Moreover, in the linear case, it is shown that if polynomials of degree k are used, the methods are kth order accurate for general triangulations; although this order of convergence is suboptimal, it is sharp for the LDG methods. Preliminary numerical examples displaying the performance of the method are shown. }

abstract = {This paper presents a novel constrained integration (CINT) method for solving initial boundary value partial differential equations (PDEs). The CINT method combines classical Galerkin methods with a constrained backpropogation training approach to obtain an artificial neural network representation of the PDE solution that approximately satisfies the boundary conditions at every integration step. The advantage of CINT over existing methods is that it is readily applicable to solving PDEs on irregular domains, and requires no special modification for domains with complex geometries. Furthermore, the CINT method provides a semi-analytical solution that is infinitely differentiable. In this paper the CINT method is demonstrated on two hyperbolic and one parabolic initial boundary value problems with a known analytical solutions that can be used for performance comparison. The numerical results show that, when compared to the most efficient finite element methods, the CINT method achieves significant improvements both in terms of computational time and accuracy.}
